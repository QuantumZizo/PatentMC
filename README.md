# PatentMC
PatentMC is a datapack I made utilizing an exploit showcased by Purplers in his video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9cuItC_O8 that can "self destruct" the world it's in if a specific person joins. I was inspired to make this datapack because I saw a lot of videos of peoples creations being stolen so I wanted to make a datapack that would stop specific people from entering the world as shown above. The idea is that youtubers and other creators could use this datapack to protect against people who like to steal content like Stevee.

## How to use PatentMC
To use PatentMC you simple have to add the datapack to the world you would like to "patent" and then log into the world and use /function patentmc:install. Then add the Minecraft usernames of the people you'd like to not be able to join to the team blacklist using /team join blacklisted (username). Then feel free to remove the datapack and distribute the world among people and feel safe from content stealers. If you want to learn more about how this datapack works, I suggest you watch Purplers video on it with the link I put above.
