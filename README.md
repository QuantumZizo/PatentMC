# World-Protecter
World Protector is a datapack I made utilizing an exploit showcased by Purplers in his video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kv9cuItC_O8 that can "self destruct" the world it's in if a specific person joins.

## How to use
To use World Protector simply drop World-Protecter.zip into the datapacks folder of your world that you want to protect. Next log into the world and add anyone you want to be blacklisted from the world to the team blacklisted using /team join blacklisted (username of person you want to blacklist). Then feel free to distribute the protected world that hosts your creation and be safe from copy-cats. (At least from the ones you blacklisted.)
